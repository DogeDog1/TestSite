      This is a comment header. It is done using the
      < ! - - at the beginning and - - > at the end (without the spaces)

      These are the different sizes of headers. 1 is largest, 6 is smallest
      Good for separating different sections of text. Good for titles
      Good for annoying the crap out of peoples eyes (overuse)
    -->
    <h1>SUPAH HUGE HEADER</h1>
    <h2>Semi-smaller HUGE HEDADAH</h2>
    <h3>Still smaller header</h3>
    <h4>Is this even a header anymore?</h4>
    <h5>really small header</h5>
    <h6>Baisically text at this point</h6>

    <!--
      Unordered lists.
      Useful for listing stuff in no particular order. Who would've known

      Everything in HTML can be given a name using class="some-name". EVERYTHING.
      this "class" identifier can be used to edit its format with CSS.
      Formatting of the list can be more controlled in CSS, too.
      More on that later.

    <ul class="dank-list">
      <li>This is a list item (as denoted by the li tag)</li>
      <li>Each LI is placed within a UL, or unordered list</li>
      <li>These can be useful for listing tons of links</li>
      <li>Or useless inforation nobody cares about.</li>
      <li>Or the dankest of memes. Your pick</li>
    </ul>

    <!--
      Links are really useful on websites. They connect your website together
      or they make cool shit happen.

      you use <link> to make a link right? *que annoying buzzer sound*

      Use <a> tags for links. The syntax is as follows:
      <a href="webpage-address.com">Link Text goes here</a>
      This prints a link to webpage-address.com in the form of
      "Link Text goes here"

      Like I said. Don't forget aobut lists.

      NOTE: Multiple tags can be be nested within oneanother. Shown below.
